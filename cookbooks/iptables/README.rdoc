= DESCRIPTION:

Sets up iptables and installs a base iptable.

if node[:iptables][:reject_input], and node[:iptables][:reject_output]
  are set to true and the activate recipe and default recipe are
  applied a white label policy is in place where only
  connections specified in recipes will be allowed

Activate is a separate recipe to allow iptables to be defined and
then activated at a later time(once all the rules are defined)
