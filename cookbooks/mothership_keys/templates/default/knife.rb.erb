# This is the knife config for the meta mothership server
# that has access to chef servers on staging, demo and production 
# environment.

# A new client with name 'mothership.prod.versapay.com' has to be created
# manually on each chef servers. The resulting client.pem
# have to be stored manually in # /home/deploy/.chef/{ENV}/client.pem
# where {ENV} is stag, demo and prod.
#
# Once that's done running CHEF=stag knife node list
# should run knife against the staging chef server.
#
# In mothership UI, you can define pipelines as follow:
#   export CHEF=stag
#   knife ssh 'role:eft3' 'sudo chef-client -V'
